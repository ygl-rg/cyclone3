This is a complete cyclone.bottle demo.
For a basic hello world, check out the helloworld_bottle.py demo.

The idea is to show how easy it is to create simple bottle-like apps, and
still capture all the functionality such as database support, setting
a parent class (the BaseHandler) for your request handlers and integrating with
other types of handlers such as XmlRPC and WebSocket.

The authentication mechanism is similar to the one used in
httpauthdemo_redis.py and require that the "cyclone:user" key exists in redis.

Basically, run the redis server and use the redis client to set up a fake
user account:

  $ redis-cli set cyclone:root 123

Then authenticate yourself at http://localhost:8888 as root/123.

XmlRPC functionality can be tested by executing the xmlrpc_client.py.
